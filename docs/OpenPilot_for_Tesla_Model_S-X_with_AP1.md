## Improving your AP1

- Please read and understand the Disclaimers and Licensing.

With Tesla no longer paying any attention to the older Model S (the [AP1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Hardware_1) was based on the Mobile Eye platform that Tesla dumped in October 2016 and has received limited code updates ever since), the only option to get new features and functionality is by joining our community and running the Tinkla branch of Open Pilot created specifically and only for Tesla vehicles.
