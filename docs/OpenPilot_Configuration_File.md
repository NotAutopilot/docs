# OpenPilot Configuration File

```
This file is only used in the older versions of Tesla Openpilot (v0.6.6 and v0.7.4). The newer versions of OpenPilot based on Tesla Unity do all these configurations via the user interface.
```

The OpenPilot settings for Tesla are located in`/data/bb_openpilot.cfg`.
You can edit this file for your car and it will not be modified as you change through versions of OP. If new options are added in the future, just the new options and comments will be added to your config without changing your other edits.
